# Event Editor Table Panel

> Libre Grafana Panel to assign Downtime Event Reasons

This panel gives users the ability to list downtime reasons and edit them to assign a downtime category, reason and comment. Users can also split event to correctly capture downtime information. This panel is part of [Libre](https://github.com/Spruik/Libre). Downtime categories and reasons are defined in [Libre Reason Code CRUD Tree Chart Panel](https://github.com/Spruik/Libre-Reason-Codes-CRUD-Tree-Chart-Panel). This plugin interfaces to a no security json rest api for materials running on the same grafana server. This panel is targeted at Grafana v6.x.x only.

## Usage

In order to get the most out of this panel:

1. Add dashboard variables for *Site*, *Area* and *Line* from the database. For example:

| Variable | Definition                                                                                                      |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $Site    | `SELECT site FROM equipment`                                                                                    |
| $Area    | `SELECT area FROM equipment WHERE area IS NOT NULL AND site = '$Site'`                                          |
| $Line    | `SELECT production_line FROM equipment WHERE production_line IS NOT NULL AND area = '$Area' AND site = '$Site'` |

2. Add a *Table* metric to query the held machine state for a given line

```influxdb
SELECT
  "Site"
  ,"Area"
  ,"Line"
  ,"status"
  ,"duration"
  ,"execute"
  ,"held"
  ,"idle"
  ,"stopped"
  ,"complete"
  ,"category"
  ,"reason"
  ,"equipment"
  ,"comment"
FROM "Availability"
WHERE $timeFilter
  AND "Site" = '$Site'
  AND "Area" = '$Area'
  AND "Line" = '$Line'
```

![Panel Metrics](./docs/libre-event-editor-table-panel-metrics.png)

3. Apply custom column styles:

| Time format should be 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS' to avoid unwanted results.

| Column               | Type   | Name Override | Other                   |
|----------------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Time                 | Date   | Time          | YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS |
| duration             | String | Duration      |            -            |
| status               | String | Status        |            -            |
| category             | String | Category      |            -            |
| reason               | String | Reason        |            -            |
| comment              | String | Comment       |            -            |
| execute              | Hidden |       -       |            -            |
| held                 | Hidden |       -       |            -            |
| idle                 | Hidden |       -       |            -            |
| stopped              | Hidden |       -       |            -            |
| complete             | Hidden |       -       |            -            |
| durationint          | Hidden |       -       |            -            |
| Site                 | Hidden |       -       |            -            |
| Area                 | Hidden |       -       |            -            |
| Line                 | Hidden |       -       |            -            |
| equipment            | Hidden |       -       |            -            |

4. Configure the panel Row Option `Min Duration:` to the shortest downtime duration to display in minutes. Use this setting to avoid nuisance events. For example 5.

5. Data configuration:

- Measurement:  `Availability`
- Reason codes: `reason_code`
- Equipment:    `equipment`

### Add/Edit Reason

Click the event in the table, select a category and reason. Type in a comment and click save.

### Split Reason

Click the event in the table, select a category and reason. Type in a comment and click split. Drag the slider to the correct time to split the event. Alternatively use the edit button, type in the desired timestamp and click save. Use the left/right select to choose which side of the split event to apply the currently selected category, reason and comment too. Click save to split the event.
